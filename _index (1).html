    <h1>E'Jjon Brown (ejjonbrown@bears.mybrcc.edu) | Web Portfolio</h1>
    <p>My name is E'Jjon Brown but go by my nickname EOB in most case scenarios. I am a online college student pursuing my Associates degree in the ETEC program at BRCC with my core focus being in interactive digital media. Upon completion of my ETEC degree this semester, I plan on going for my second Associates degree in the fine arts transfer degree starting in the fall. After this, I plan on pursuing my Bachelor's and Master's degree in film. After I am done with school, I have plans on going into the entertainment industry down the line. When school isn't my focus, I primarly stay at home. I consider myself a introvert who prefers in most case scenarios not to go out in public unless it is a necessitiy. I either read, write, watch a movie, or play a video game. My life is pretty simple and that is how I like it.   </p>
